In this project, I wrote a software pipeline to train a network using keras, but the main output or product that I created is a detailed writeup of the project.  Check out the [writeup](./writeup.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for understanding the project.  


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report
